# Contextual security

Finally, we are heading back to Australia. With all my family, we are excited to be back in Down Under and get our lives back on track. I can’t wait to hit the water in the early morning. My wife misses her friends, and my daughter is about to return to childcare and water-centred activities—an exciting time, but also stressful. Since we stopped renting our apartment on our extended overseas trip, we now have nowhere to live. It is a great idea, in theory. We can save tons of cash, but the perspective of going back and crashing at a friend’s place with no guarantee of renting something for a fixed time. The property market in Australia is a bit wild at the moment, at least as it looks from our perspective, so we wouldn’t know how long it would take to get an apartment we would be happy with forever. Fortunately, one evening, while browsing the properties, I found something interesting. I filled out all the paperwork to apply straight away, and my wife found someone to inspect the place for us. It seemed all set. With our fingers crossed, we were waiting for the response. We pushed to get the apartment, and, surprise, surprise, we got it. All is set. We just come, unpack our stuff, and we are good to go to live our Aussie dream.

Great news, all that is left is to sign the lease agreement. And here is where I get to the point of the whole essay. A few days later, I discussed the entire thing with a friend. I mentioned how we applied, how we got it, and that we were excited to have a place to live. He said something along the lines of:

“That’s cool. You can do it all online, even without being there. What about the documents? How are you going to sign them?”

“I will send a PDF doc with my signature pasted in. No issue here,” I answered with confidence.

“Pasted signature, that doesn’t mean anything. There is no security in it,” he replied with a bit of doubt.

“Yeah, I’ve been doing it in Australia this way for a while, and there are many places that accept it.” — I lost a bit of confidence, but still, internally, I felt there was nothing wrong with it.

“This signature doesn’t mean anything. You could not even send it at all. It would be the same.”

He has a point. There is no security embedded in the scanned signature that was pasted into the document. It is easy to copy. You have no guarantee that the signature belongs to the person and, even worse, that it wasn’t simply copied and pasted by somebody else. There are ways to solve the digital signature issue, but a PDF signature is not considered a secure one. Fair enough, this is not something you can unquestioningly trust. But I still believe it is a good way of confirmation in some circumstances. Not every case is the same, and not every contract needs blockchain-level security. Sometimes a loose acknowledgment could be enough. A flag that I’ve already seen.

The first factor could be the value of the transaction. For example, if you are getting a loan or selling a house, basically something with a high value, you might want to be sure that when somebody tries to cheat, you can go to court and prove the other person is lying. I’m relatively sure the judge would not consider a PDF signature a valid confirmation, so it may not be sufficient in that context.

The second thing that comes to my mind is the risk. In the apartment-renting example I started with, the documents are just the formalities. The agent has all the emails that we exchanged. He has verified the details that I provided and my references. He secured the deposit for the apartment and the initial rent. The signature on a document would not change much. He has more leverage in this case. If I were to break the agreement for some reason, I would lose much more than they would.

I firmly believe the level of security depends on the context. It is not always the same. As usual, it is a tradeoff between convenience and safety.
