# Test, test, test...

This is about to be the first story in this small blog. I’ve been thinking about publishing some stuff for a while, but I never had enough time or motivation to start doing it. But the easiest way to start something is not to wait, but to go with the flow and push it out. That’s why I’m writing this post. There won’t be much valuable content in it, so if you came here by accident, stop reading… You most likely won’t find it interesting.

With all that being said, I will first try to justify why I even want to start writing. Often, I come across an interesting topic either in programming, sport, or philosophy. I think about that a lot… Think and draw some conclusions. I realise things, try to put them together, and… never write them down. It would be cool to have my thoughts on paper and come back to them after a while, either to laugh at how silly I was or to remind me of some topics I have already forgotten.

I will be writing my thoughts about Software Engineering. I’m an Android developer with architectural ambitions during the day. Still, a small startup CTO at night or rather very early morning, so I come across multiple topics around engineering, designing, and planning software projects. I’m actively developing in Android, Flutter, and NodeJS and help maintain projects in React and iOS. Continuous Integration and Deployment, as well as managing the infrastructure in AWS, are essential parts of what I do in the startup. I can’t run away from project management and different flavours of Agile, so I have some opinions about how to handle the async team in a rapidly changing environment.

I’ve been surfing for a few years already and still don’t know how to rip… Still waiting for my first barrel and a big splash after a huge turn. So, through this blog, I wanna document my learning path. It is not easy to learn how to surf as an adult.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu has become a big part of my life as well. As a purple belt with over 7 years of training, I have my favourite techniques and way of fighting that I want to document.

As a young father, I have to find a balance between my family, passions, and professional work. That can be a real challenge, tough to overcome, and that usually needs some better or worse compromises.

So, I will finally click the publish button and hopefully start the journey of documenting my thoughts.
